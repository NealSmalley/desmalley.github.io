 <p> The last battle is the last book in the cronicles of narnia. The main charictors are King tirian, Jewel the unicorn, Eustace scrubb,
  Jillpole and puzzle the donkey. all of the other charicters from the other book also are in the book but not till the last couple of pages.
  King tirian was tricked but a ape into thinking that aslan was in narnia. The king went to find out who was killing all the talking trees
  The king went to Colormen to find the ape. He did not know that the ape was making everything up about aslan forceing them to be slaves.
  The king found out and got nokked out and stapped to a tree.
