 <p> Harry Potter the cursed child is the eight book in the series or kind of a prequel. Harry's son Albus was sent to hogwarts he was went
  on the hogwarts express for the first time with his cousin Rose. They met scorpius malfoy son of Draco Malfoy old enemys of Harry. They
  became friends on the train but Rose was not. Albus got to hogwarts and he and scorpius were out in slythin. Rose was put in to gryffindor.
  after that Albus was crushed by the expectation of being Harrys son. Scorpius was having his own problems with people believing that he
was the son of voldomort. Albus was drifting fartherand farther from his father until he blamed him for everthing. Then Harry takes the time
 turner that can go meny years in the past. Amos Diggory comes to harrys house and ascks for the time turner so that he can bring back his son.
harry rejects the idea. Delphi's uncle is Amos she takes care of him.  </p>
